   <li><h2>Identifying the Difficulties</h2>
    <p>While coding the HTML for my sports list, I faced several issues. One major difficulty was ensuring the correct use of HTML tags and structure. For example, I encountered problems with list items and headings not displaying as intended, often due to incorrect nesting or missing closing tags. Additionally, the use of hr and other formatting elements sometimes led to inconsistent spacing and alignment. The content's readability and layout were also affected by these issues, which made it challenging to achieve a polished and professional appearance.</p></li>
    <li><h2>How I solved the Difficulties</h2>
        <p>To address these challenges, I took a methodical approach. I first reviewed and corrected the HTML structure, ensuring that all tags were properly closed and nested. For instance, I made sure that all li tags were correctly placed within ul or ol tags, and that h3 headings were properly nested within list items. I also adjusted spacing and alignment by refining the use of hr and other formatting elements. By thoroughly checking the HTML for consistency and readability, and validating it to ensure correct syntax, I was able to resolve the issues and achieve a clean, well-organized presentation of the sports list.</p>
