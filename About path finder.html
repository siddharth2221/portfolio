<h1> About my project</h1>

   <li><h2>Website Description</h2>
    <p>The task involved developing an HTML page to display images of various animals, including Rabbit, Cat, Dog, Fish, and Bird. The primary objective was to ensure that each image was accurately sourced from the project directory and correctly displayed on the webpage</p>
</li>
<li><h2>Identifying the Difficulties</h2>
 <p>During the process, several challenges emerged. One major issue was ensuring the accuracy of file paths for each image. Incorrect paths resulted in broken image links, preventing some images from appearing. Additionally, the initial code lacked alt attributes, which are essential for accessibility, leaving visually impaired users without descriptions of the images. Formatting inconsistencies also posed a problem, such as missing self-closing slashes in img tags and uneven spacing, which made the code difficult to read and maintain. Lastly, verifying that image filenames and their placements in directories matched the src attributes proved challenging, as any mismatch led to issues with image display.</p></li>
 <li><h2>How I solved the Difficulties</h2>
     <p>To overcome these difficulties, I implemented several solutions. First, I corrected the file paths for each image by thoroughly checking the directory structure and ensuring that each src attribute pointed to the correct image file. I added descriptive alt attributes to improve accessibility, allowing screen readers to convey the image content to visually impaired users. I also standardized the formatting by ensuring consistent spacing and using self-closing tags for img elements, which enhanced the readability of the code. Finally, I verified that image filenames and their directory placements matched the src attributes to ensure that all images displayed correctly. By addressing these challenges and implementing targeted solutions, I ensured that the HTML page was functional, accessible, and well-organized.</p>
