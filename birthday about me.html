<h1> About my project</h1>

   <li><h2>Website Description</h2>
    <p>The HTML code is designed to celebrate and share information about a birthday event. The page prominently features a heading announcing "It's My Birthday," followed by the date of the celebration, September 5th. An image of a birthday cake with candles is included to visually enhance the page and add a festive touch. The code also provides a list of items guests should bring, including balloons, cake, and an appetite, which adds a personal and humorous touch. Lastly, a link to Google Maps is provided, directing guests to the event location with the help of a map.</P>

    <li><h2>Identifying the Difficulties</h2>
        <p>One of the initial challenges was ensuring that the heading tags were correctly closed to maintain proper HTML syntax and structure. Incorrectly closed tags could lead to display issues or formatting problems. Another challenge was ensuring that the image source URL was correct and accessible. If the URL was broken or incorrect, the image would not appear. Additionally, ensuring that the alt attribute for the image was descriptive enough to convey its content was crucial for accessibility purposes. Lastly, providing a functional link to Google Maps that correctly directed users to the event location required careful verification of the URL.</p>
        <li><h2>How I solved the Difficulties</h2>
            <p>To address the HTML syntax issue, I corrected the improperly closed heading tags by ensuring that each h1 and h2 tag was properly closed with /h1 and /h2. I verified the image URL to ensure it was correct and accessible, allowing the birthday cake image to display properly on the page. The alt attribute for the image was revised to be more descriptive, helping users who rely on screen readers understand the content of the image. I tested the Google Maps link to ensure it directed users to the correct location and updated the link as needed to ensure it functioned properly. These solutions ensured that the HTML page was both functional and accessible, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
